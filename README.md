# CNN-Pre-Initialization-by-Minimalistic-Part-Learning-for-Handwritten-Numeral-Recognition

### Description
This paper performs handwritten numeral recognition. In this we pre-initialize the convolutional neural networks(CNN) by part learning. Two CNNs are pre-intialized with just the top-half(with bottom-half masked) and bottom-half(with top-half masked)of the 5% of the training data respectively. The CNNs are fine tuned using the remaining 95% training data. The probabilistcs softmax scores of two CNNS are fused to decide the test label.
