# CNN-Pre-Initialization-by-Minimalistic-Part-Learning-for-Handwritten-Numeral-Recognition

### Usage

**Step 1. Taking 5% samples from training data.**   
Data Preparation.ipynb   
**Step 2. Preparing 5% samples for top-half view and bottom-half view**   
Top Half & Bottom Half Preparation.ipynb    
**Step 3. Pre-Intializing CNN using top-half 5% samples, fine tuning it with 95% training data and getting predicted probabilty scores.**     
**Step 4. Pre-Intializing CNN using bottom-half 5% samples, fine tuning it with 95% training data and getting predicted probabilty scores.**     
**Step 5. Fusing the scores (average or max function) to predict the output class.**
